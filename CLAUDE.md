# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Video Podcast Room Setup & Workflow Guide. The project focuses on designing and documenting a complete video podcast production system for daily recording with efficient post-production turnaround.

## Project Structure

This is a documentation-focused project with the following structure:
- `Video-Podcast-Setup-Guide.md` - Main documentation file containing complete setup guide
- No code files, configuration files, or build processes

## Content Architecture

The guide is organized into the following major sections:

### Hardware Setup
- **Audio Equipment**: Microphone selection (Shure SM7B recommended), audio interfaces (Zoom PodTrak P8, Rodecaster Pro II, Tascam Model 12), and accessories
- **Video Equipment**: Camera setup (Sony ZV-E10, Canon M50 Mark II), live switching systems (ATEM Mini Pro ISO, ATEM Television Studio HD8 ISO), and monitoring equipment
- **Lighting & Infrastructure**: Professional LED lighting systems, power distribution, and support equipment

### Two Main Workflow Options
1. **Basic Setup (~$16,455)**: ATEM Mini Pro ISO + separate audio recording
2. **Professional Setup (~$18,595)**: ATEM Television Studio HD8 ISO with Audio Follow Video (AFV)

### Key Technical Concepts
- **Audio Follow Video (AFV)**: Automatic audio mixing that follows camera switches
- **ISO Recording**: Individual camera file recording with synchronized audio
- **Signal Flow**: Complete audio and video routing from source to final output

### Post-Production Workflow
- Software recommendations (Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects)
- Automation tools (AutoPod for multicam editing)
- Template-based workflows for efficiency

## Working with This Repository

### Document Editing Guidelines
- Maintain consistent formatting and section structure
- Keep technical specifications accurate and up-to-date
- Preserve the detailed budget breakdowns and equipment recommendations
- Update pricing information when making changes to equipment recommendations

### Content Updates
- When updating equipment recommendations, ensure compatibility across the entire signal chain
- Maintain the comparison between basic and professional setups
- Keep workflow timings realistic based on actual production experience

### No Build Process
This is a documentation-only repository with no build, test, or lint commands. Changes can be made directly to the markdown files.

## Key Decision Points Documented

The guide helps users choose between:
- Different audio interface options based on needs and budget
- Basic vs professional video switching systems
- AFV vs manual audio mixing workflows
- Various camera and lens combinations for different shooting scenarios

## Equipment Integration Focus

The documentation emphasizes:
- Complete signal flow from microphones to final recording
- Compatibility between different equipment choices
- Scalability from basic to professional setups
- Daily operational workflows and efficiency optimization
